## Dataset EDA Implications

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) can provide important insights into the customer churn dataset. 

By visualizing the data and identifying correlations between variables, researchers can gain a better understanding of the factors that influence customer churn. For example, by comparing the churn status variable with other variables such as tenure, monthly charges, and payment method, researchers can identify customer segments that are more likely to churn.

Similarly, by analyzing the relationship between internet service and online security, researchers can identify the factors that contribute to customer satisfaction and retention.


## Insights and Predictions from the Dataset
By analyzing the university ranking dataset, researchers can make valuable predictions and insights about the performance of universities. For example, by analyzing the trend in rankings over time, researchers can identify universities that are likely to improve or decline in the future. Similarly, by analyzing the performance of universities in different regions, researchers can identify the factors that contribute to their success and make predictions about the future performance of universities in those regions.
